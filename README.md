# SCSS Compiler

A Sublime Text 3 plugin which compiles the selected SCSS to CSS in your document.

# Installation
This plugin depends on the 'python-scss' application, which can be installed using PIP.
```
pip install scss
```
This script also assumes that the `scss` binary is in the following location: `/usr/local/bin`.

# Usage
Select the SCSS which you wish to compile, right click and select "Compile selected SCSS to CSS". You may need to wait a few seconds for Python to do it's thing, and then your SCSS should then be transformed into CSS!
